# Explanation of the Code

## Import Statements:

`import React, { useState } from "react";` imports React and the `useState` hook. `useState` is used to add state to functional components.

## ToDoList Component:

A functional component named `ToDoList` is defined to manage the list of tasks and user interactions.

## State Variables:

`tasks`: An array that stores the list of tasks. It's initialized with some default tasks.
`newTask`: A string that holds the current value of the input field for adding new tasks.

## Event Handlers:

`handleInputChange`: Updates the `newTask` state with the value entered in the input field.
`addTask`: Adds the value of `newTask` to the `tasks` array if it's not empty. Clears the input field afterward.
`deleteTask`: Removes a task from the `tasks` array at the specified index.
`moveTaskUp`: Swaps a task with the one above it in the array to move it up.
`moveTaskDown`: Swaps a task with the one below it in the array to move it down.

## Rendering:

The component renders an input field, an "Add" button, and an ordered list (`<ol>`) of tasks.
For each task, "Delete," "Move Up," and "Move Down" buttons are provided to modify the task list dynamically.
